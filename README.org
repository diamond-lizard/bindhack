More information about the shim and how and why to use it can be found in [[http://daniel-lange.com/authors/1-Daniel-Lange][Daniel Lange]]'s article [[http://daniel-lange.com/archives/53-Binding-applications-to-a-specific-IP.html][Binding applications to a specific IP]]

A simple LD_PRELOAD hack to let you specify the source address
for all outbound connections or if you want to limit a process
to only listening on one IP
